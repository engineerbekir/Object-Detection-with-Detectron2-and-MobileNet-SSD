# Object-Detection-with-Detectron2-and-MobileNet-SSD

## MOBILENET SSD

### What is MobilenetSSD?
- Deep neural networks are used to develop a model which consists of multiple layers to classify the given objects into any of the defined classes. 
These objects are detected by making use of higher resolution feature maps and are possible because of the recent advancement in deep learning with image processing. 
[Mobilenet-SSD](https://ebenezertechs.com/mobilenet-ssd-using-opencv-3-4-1-deep-learning-module-python/) is an object detection model that computes the output bounding box and class of an object from an input image. This Single Shot Detector (SSD) object detection model uses Mobilenet as the backbone and can achieve fast object detection optimized for mobile devices.

## DETECTRON2
### What is Detectron2 exactly?
- [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) is Facebook's new vision library that allows use to easily use and 
create object detection,instance segmentation, keypoint detection and panoptic segmentation models.

## How Does It Work ? 

- Requirement: Firstly; Install Detectron2, OpenCV DNN and Qt Creator. 
- Thanks to Qt Creator, its design is realized.
- Pytorch-based Detectron2 algorithm and using TensorFlow deep learning framework MobileNet SSD trained on MS COCO dataset are  used and thus object detection, speed and accuracy control are performed using these models..


## Conclusions
- Real-time object detection and tracking on video streams is a crucial topic of surveillance systems in many field applications. 
The objective of our paper is to make a comparative study on two object recognition systems using CNN to identify the objects in the images. 
I studied and analyzed the Detectron2 object detection model and MobileNet SSD model for performance evaluation in same 
scenario. Each of the compared models has its own unique properties and is successful in its respective application. Detectron2 provides better accuracy compared to MobileNet SSD, which provides more detection speed.
