## MOBILENET-SSD

### What is MobilenetSSD?
- Deep neural networks are used to develop a model which consists of multiple layers to classify the given objects into any of the defined classes. 
These objects are detected by making use of higher resolution feature maps and are possible because of the recent advancement in deep learning with image processing. 
Mobilenet SSD is an object detection model that computes the output bounding box and class of an object from an input image. This Single Shot Detector (SSD) object detection model uses Mobilenet as the backbone and can achieve fast object detection optimized for mobile devices.

## DETECTRON2
- [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) is Facebook's new vision library that allows use to easily use and 
create object detection,instance segmentation, keypoint detection and panoptic segmentation models.
